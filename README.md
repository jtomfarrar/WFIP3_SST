# Scripts to download/plot SST for WFIP3 region

Plan for now is to use a blended AVHRR-VIIRS product provided by NOAA Coastwatch:
- https://eastcoast.coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw_avhrr-viirs_sst.php
- AVHRR is on MetOp-A, MetOp-B, MetOp-C
- VIIRS is on SNPP, NOAA-20, NOAA-21
- NOAA data access page for MA region: https://eastcoast.coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw_data_access.php
  - The page above has multiple data sets, including chlorophyll and true color imagery
